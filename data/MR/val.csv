'the war of the roses , ' trailer-trash style . entertaining but like shooting fish in a barrel .	-1
it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past .	-1
this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it's a taunt -a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered .	1
there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .	-1
the ring is worth a look , if you don't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your halloween entertainment .	1

. . . a vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll .	1
implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most american of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest hollywood document of all .	1
nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro's right-hand goombah .	-1
if the film's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start .	1
a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , read my lips is an original . this is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent .	1
deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel .	-1
. . . even if you've never heard of chaplin , you'll still be glued to the screen .	1
by-the-numbers yarn .	-1
the sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in imax dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins .	1
kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning .	-1
the film's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but it's propelled by the acting .	1
the kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself .	1
the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .	-1
mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .	-1
shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom .	-1
rife with the rueful , wry humor springing out of yiddish culture and language .	1
its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered .	-1
although the level of the comedy declines as the movie proceeds , there's no denying the fun of watching de niro and crystal having fun .	1
the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke's artistic aspirations , but he hasn't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul .	-1
so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor .	1
uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance .	1
like all of egoyan's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious .	1
meyjes' provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil .	1
ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke .	-1
leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema . he allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue . this method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here .	1
a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series .	-1
at its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best .	1
if you're not totally weirded- out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle , quitting hits home with disorienting force .	1
there's real visual charge to the filmmaking , and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence .	1
the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere .	-1
philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .	-1
drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality .	-1
content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .	-1
this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy .	1
there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .	-1
denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others .	-1
morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start .	1
like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless .	-1
a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either .	-1
there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .	-1
godawful boring slug of a movie .	-1
wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives !	-1
this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .	-1
though a capable thriller , somewhere along the way k-19 jettisoned some crucial drama .	1
seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil .	1
mais um momento inspirado de david fincher .	1
while [hill] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film .	-1
an uninspired preachy and clichd war film .	-1
conceptually brilliant . . . plays like a living-room war of the worlds , gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown .	1
every dance becomes about seduction , where backstabbing and betrayals are celebrated , and sex is currency .	1
the whole talking-animal thing is grisly .	-1
disturbing and brilliant documentary .	1
the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs .	-1
how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood . it's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .	1

fairly run-of-the-mill .	-1
solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me .	-1
there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version .	-1
this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year !	1
another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it .	1
even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation cannot engage .	-1
some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the ball and chain .	1
the powerful success of read my lips with such provocative material shows why , after only three films , director/co-writer jacques audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of french filmmakers .	1
as lively an account as seinfeld is deadpan .	1
unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .	-1
suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness .	-1
with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm .	-1
the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .	-1
jonathan parker's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films .	-1
no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continuao , harold ramis deve ter sado da cama com o p esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme tambm .	-1
everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized .	-1
a riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban hades .	1
steers refreshingly clear of the usual cliches .	1
stevenson's performance is at once clueless and fiercely committed , a volatile combination .	1
funny in a sick , twisted sort of way .	1
lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling .	-1
it's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .	-1
secretary manages a neat trick , bundling the flowers of perversity , comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie .	1
. . . blade ii is more enjoyable than the original .	1
if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .	-1
the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects .	-1
it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .	-1
what [frei] gives us . . . is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows .	-1
cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .	-1
sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation .	-1
marinated in clichs and mawkish dialogue .	-1
the action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the star wars series .	1
ultimately . . . the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults .	-1
blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period .	-1
a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .	-1
gently humorous and touching .	1
as home movie gone haywire , it's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , i'd rather listen to old tori amos records .	1
so stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly .	-1
the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either doesn't notice when his story ends or just can't tear himself away from the characters -- but it's smooth and professional .	1
the limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie .	1
at times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it's so fascinating you won't be able to look away for a second .	1
i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s .	-1
some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .	-1
a spellbinding african film about the modern condition of rootlessness , a state experienced by millions around the globe .	1

the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments .	-1
an odd drama set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the midwest that held my interest precisely because it didn't try to .	1
hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture .	-1
there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel .	-1
thoroughly engrossing and ultimately tragic .	1
parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core .	-1
thoughtful , provocative and entertaining .	1
it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate .	-1
"director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the "" miami vice "" checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash ."	-1
lan yu is a genuine love story , full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery .	1
go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .	-1
at its worst the screenplay is callow , but at its best it is a young artist's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood .	1
any movie that makes hard work seem heroic deserves a look .	1
it is intensely personal and yet -- unlike quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times .	1
less than fresh .	-1
it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .	-1
despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .	-1
any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors .	-1
insufferably naive .	-1
about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .	-1
both grant and hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others .	1
the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained .	-1
a perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little lilo & stitch had in spades -- charisma .	1
an entertaining documentary that freshly considers arguments the bard's immortal plays were written by somebody else .	1
ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout  and meat loaf explodes .	-1
imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women . it may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made .	1
though it's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working-class .	1
the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .	-1
while it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight .	1
a worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions .	1
my big fat greek wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor .	1
it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .	-1

naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep .	-1
the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .	-1
the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental .	-1
"the star who helped give a spark to "" chasing amy "" and "" changing lanes "" falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , "" the sum of all fears . """	-1
an intelligent , earnest , intimate film that drops the ball only when it pauses for blunt exposition to make sure you're getting its metaphysical point .	1
propelled not by characters but by caricatures .	-1
britney spears' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction .	-1
as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired .	-1
a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie's peter pan .	-1
moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought . better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift .	1

the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .	-1
barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time	-1
rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic .	1
it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it .	-1
full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .	-1
alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl .	-1
ferrara directs the entire film with the kind of detachment that makes any given frame look like a family's custom-made christmas card .	1
moretti's compelling anatomy of grief and the difficult process of adapting to loss .	1

trades run-of-the-mill revulsion for extreme unease .	1
on top of a foundering performance , [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag .	-1

'enigma' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of 'we were soldiers . '	1

she's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations .	1
for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .	-1
a thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it doesn't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world .	1
the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood .	-1
poetry in motion captured on film . while it can be a bit repetitive , overall it's an entertaining and informative documentary .	1
as saccharine as it is disposable .	-1
its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time .	1
this illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the holy land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath .	1

if signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere .	1
trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all .	-1
to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .	-1
os problemas tm incio a partir do momento em que samos do cinema e comeamos a pensar sobre o que acabamos de ver .  ento que sinais realmente desaponta .	1
whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like .	1

all three women deliver remarkable performances .	1
it's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests .	1
a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis .	1
this engrossing , characteristically complex tom clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time .	1
evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention .	-1
it's not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered .	1
once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .	-1
the actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them .	1

each of these stories has the potential for touched by an angel simplicity and sappiness , but thirteen conversations about one thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments .	1
what makes salton sea surprisingly engrossing is that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion .	1
this is a very fine movie -- go see it .	1
deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits .	-1
